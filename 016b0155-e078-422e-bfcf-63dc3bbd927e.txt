OFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY
The text of this measure can be found on the Secretary of State's website at
voterguide.sos.ca.gov.
• Increases funding sources for K-12 public
schools, community colleges, and local
governments by requiring commercial and
industrial real property be taxed based on
current market value, instead of purchase
price.
• Exempts from taxation changes: residential
properties; agricultural land; and owners of
commercial and industrial properties with
combined value of $3 million or less.
Any additional education funding will
supplement existing school funding
guarantees.
ANALYSIS BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST
BACKGROUND
Local Governments Tax Property. California cities,
counties, schools, and special districts (such as
a fire protection district) collect property taxes
from property owners based on the value of their
property. Property taxes raise around $65 billion
each year for these local governments. Overall,
about 60 percent of property taxes go to cities,
counties, and special districts. The other
40 percent goes to schools and community
colleges. These shares are different in different
counties.
Property Includes Land, Buildings, Machinery,
and Equipment. Property taxes apply to many
kinds of property. Land and buildings are taxed.
Businesses also pay property taxes on most
other things they own. This includes equipment,
machinery, computers, and furniture. We call
these things "business equipment."
How Is a Property Tax Bill Calculated? Each
property owner's annual property tax bill is equal
to the taxable value of their property multiplied
by their property tax rate. The typical property
owner's property tax rate is 1.1 percent.
Taxable Value of Land and Buildings Is Based on
Original Purchase Price. In the year a piece of

SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE
OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT
FISCAL IMPACT:
• Increased property taxes on commercial
properties worth more than $3 million
providing $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion in new
funding to local governments and schools.
land or a building is purchased, its taxable value
typically is its purchase price. Each year after
that, the property's taxable value is adjusted for
inflation by up to 2 percent. When a property
is sold again, its taxable value is reset to its
new purchase price. The taxable value of most
land and buildings is less than what they could
be sold for. This is because the price most
properties could be sold for grows faster than
2 percent per year.
Taxable Value of Business Equipment Is Based on
How Much It Could Be Sold for. Unlike land and
buildings, business equipment is taxed based on
how much it could be sold for today.
Counties Manage the Property Tax. County
assessors determine the taxable value of
property. County tax collectors bill property
owners. County auditors distribute tax revenue
to local governments. Statewide, counties spend
about $800 million each year on these activities.

ANALYSIS BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST
land and buildings to be taxed based on how
much they could be sold for instead of their
original purchase price. This change is put in
place over time starting in 2022. The change
does not start before 2025 for properties used
by California businesses that meet certain rules
and have 50 or fewer employees. Housing and
agricultural land continues to be taxed based on
its original purchase price.
Some Lower Value Properties Not Included.
This change does not apply if the owner has
$3 million or less worth of commercial land and
buildings in California djusted for inflation
every two years). These properties continue to be
taxed based on original purchase price.
Reduce Taxes on Business Equipment. The
measure reduces the taxable value of each
business's equipment by $500,000 starting
in 2024. Businesses with less than $500,000
of equipment pay no taxes on those items.
All property taxes on business equipment are
eliminated for California businesses that meet
certain rules and have 50 or fewer employees.
FISCAL EFFECTS
Increased Taxes on Commercial Land and Buildings.
Most owners of commercial land and buildings
worth more than $3 million would pay higher
property taxes. Only some of these property
owners would start to pay higher taxes in
2022. By 2025, most of these property owners
would pay higher taxes. Beginning in 2025,
total property taxes from commercial land
and buildings probably would be $8 billion to
$12.5 billion higher in most years. The value of
commercial property can change a lot from year
to year. This means the amount of increased
property taxes also could change a lot from year
to year.
Decreased Taxes on Business Equipment. Property
taxes on business equipment probably would be
several hundred million dollars lower each year.
Money Set Aside to Pay Costs of the Measure.
The measure sets aside money for various
CONTINUED
costs created by the measure. This includes
giving several hundred million dollars per year to
counties to pay for their costs of carrying out
the measure. The measure would increase the
amount of work county assessors do and could
require changes in how they do their work.
Counties could have costs from the measure
before new money is available to cover these
costs. The state would loan money to counties
to cover these initial costs until new property tax
revenue is available.
New Funding for Local Governments and Schools.
Overall, $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion per
year in new property taxes would go to local
governments. 60 percent would go to cities,
counties, and special districts. Each city,
county, or special district's share of the money
depends on several things including the amount
of new taxes paid by commercial properties in
that community. Not all governments would be
guaranteed new money. Some in rural areas may
end up losing money because of lower taxes on
business equipment. The other 40 percent would
increase funding for schools and community
colleges. Each school or community college's
share of the money is mostly based on how many
students they have.
