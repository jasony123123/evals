California cities,\ncounties, schools, and special districts (such as\na fire protection district) collect property taxes\nfrom property owners based on the value of their\nproperty. Property taxes raise around $65 billion\neach year for these local governments. Overall,\nabout 60 percent of property taxes go to cities,\ncounties, and special districts. The other\n40 percent goes to schools and community\ncolleges. These shares are different in different\ncounties.\nProperty Includes Land, Buildings, Machinery,\nand Equipment. Property taxes apply to many\nkinds of property. Land and buildings are taxed.\nBusinesses also pay property taxes on most\nother things they own. This includes equipment,\nmachinery, computers, and furniture. We call\nthese things \"business equipment.\"\nHow Is a Property Tax Bill Calculated? Each\nproperty owner's annual property tax bill is equal\nto the taxable value of their property multiplied\nby their property tax rate.

Each year after\nthat, the property's taxable value is adjusted for\ninflation by up to 2 percent. When a property\nis sold again, its taxable value is reset to its\nnew purchase price. The taxable value of most\nland and buildings is less than what they could\nbe sold for. This is because the price most\nproperties could be sold for grows faster than\n2 percent per year.\nTaxable Value of Business Equipment Is Based on\nHow Much It Could Be Sold for. Unlike land and\nbuildings, business equipment is taxed based on\nhow much it could be sold for today.\nCounties Manage the Property Tax. County\nassessors determine the taxable value of\nproperty. County tax collectors bill property\nowners. County auditors distribute tax revenue\nto local governments.

This change is put in\nplace over time starting in 2022. The change\ndoes not start before 2025 for properties used\nby California businesses that meet certain rules\nand have 50 or fewer employees. Housing and\nagricultural land continues to be taxed based on\nits original purchase price.\nSome Lower Value Properties Not Included.\nThis change does not apply if the owner has\n$3 million or less worth of commercial land and\nbuildings in California djusted for inflation\nevery two years). These properties continue to be\ntaxed based on original purchase price.\nReduce Taxes on Business Equipment. The\nmeasure reduces the taxable value of each\nbusiness's equipment by $500,000 starting\nin 2024. Businesses with less than $500,000\nof equipment pay no taxes on those items.\nAll property taxes on business equipment are\neliminated for California businesses that meet\ncertain rules and have 50 or fewer employees.\nFISCAL EFFECTS\nIncreased Taxes on Commercial Land and Buildings.\nMost owners of commercial land and buildings\nworth more than $3 million would pay higher\nproperty taxes. Only some of these property\nowners would start to pay higher taxes in\n2022. By 2025, most of these property owners\nwould pay higher taxes. Beginning in 2025,\ntotal property taxes from commercial land\nand buildings probably would be $8 billion to\n$12.5 billion higher in most years. The value of\ncommercial property can change a lot from year\nto year. This means the amount of increased\nproperty taxes also could change a lot from year\nto year.\nDecreased Taxes on Business Equipment. Property\ntaxes on business equipment probably would be\nseveral hundred million dollars lower each year.\nMoney Set Aside to Pay Costs of the Measure.\nThe measure sets aside money for various\nCONTINUED\ncosts created by the measure. This includes\ngiving several hundred million dollars per year to\ncounties to pay for their costs of carrying out\nthe measure. The measure would increase the\namount of work county assessors do and could\nrequire changes in how they do their work.\nCounties could have costs from the measure\nbefore new money is available to cover these\ncosts. The state would loan money to counties\nto cover these initial costs until new property tax\nrevenue is available.\nNew Funding for Local Governments and Schools.\nOverall, $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion per\nyear in new property taxes would go to local\ngovernments. 60 percent would go to cities,\ncounties, and special districts. Each city,\ncounty, or special district's share of the money\ndepends on several things including the amount\nof new taxes paid by commercial properties in\nthat community. Not all governments would be\nguaranteed new money. Some in rural areas may\nend up losing money because of lower taxes on\nbusiness equipment. The other 40 percent would\nincrease funding for schools and community\ncolleges.
